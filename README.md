# Marten Engine – Simple 3D Game Engine on C++
---

My project, which I personally develop as a student. This is one of my big projects that I want to see released (or at least beta version XD).
I have some experience developing games on Unreal Engine 4/5 and I enjoy digging into the structure of game files. Some functions may have to be rewritten or not be logical, but I'll be glad if someone tells me how to make them better :D.

### Additional libraries and resources used in the project:
---
Libraries:
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) – Cross-platform OpenGL and Vulkan graphics library
- [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/) – Generated library for loading OpenGL function pointers
- [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) – GUI

Fonts:
- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) – Simple and pleasant font

### Installation
---
Just clone the repository and run the Makefile:
```
make -f .\Makefile all
```

p.s. yes, I haven't learned CMake yet, so I'm digging through Makefile.
